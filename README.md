Wizard’s Duel AR is a cross-platform, multiplayer AR brawler for players with ARKit- and ARCore-supported smartphones. Two or more players engage in real-time combat by blasting each other with magic and defending themselves with shields. There are no win conditions or rules. Players can host new duels and join or spectate existing duels.

This is a prototype I developed showcasing what you can do combining augmented reality with real-time multiplayer networking. 

The project is not currently supported. 

## Stack

I used Unity for the game engine, [GameSparks](https://docs.gamesparks.com/tutorials/real-time-services/) for real-time multiplayer networking, and [Google Cloud Anchors](https://developers.google.com/ar/develop/java/cloud-anchors/overview-android) for shared augmented reality experiences.
